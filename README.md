# Road_accident_analysis
## Project objective
This dashboard presents a comprehensive overview of road accidents, providing insights into key metrics and trends. The data is visualized using a combination of charts and graphs, making it easy to understand and interpret.
## Dataset used
 https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VWOXoOe2MnaW_C_jjYXyUrU0BCikhYUI/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=111213189713968350178&rtpof=true&sd=true
## Requirements
* Primary KPI - Total Casualties and Total Accident values for Current Year and YoY growth
* Primary KPI's - Total Casualties by Accident Severity for Current Year and YoY growth
* Secondary KPI's - Total casualities with respect to vehical type for current year
* Monthly trend showing comparision of casualities for current year and previous year
* Casualities by road type for current year
* Current year casualities by area/location & by day/night
* Total casualities and total accidents by location
## Project Insights:
Overall Accident Picture:
   * Total casualties have decreased by 11.7% compared to the previous year.
   * Total accidents have also seen a significant drop of 33.3%.
   * However, it's crucial to note that fatal casualties have only decreased by 16.2%, indicating a need for further investigation into the causes of these fatalities.
Casualty Trends:
   * The "CY Casualities vs PY Casualities monthly trend" chart shows a fluctuating pattern, with spikes in certain months. This suggests seasonal variations or specific events that may be contributing to accidents.
   * Accident Factors:
   * "Casualities by Road Type" reveals that single carriageway roads have the highest number of casualties, followed by dual carriageways.
   * "Casualities by Light Condition" shows that a significant portion of accidents happen during dark conditions.
Vehicle Involvement:
   * "Casualities by Vehicle Type" highlights that cars are the most frequently involved vehicles in accidents.
## Key Metrics:
 * Total CY Casualties: 195.7K
 * Total CY Accidents: 144.4K
 * CY Fatal Casualties: 2.9K
 * CY Serious Casualties: 27.0K
 * CY Slight Casualties: 165.8K
## Visualizations:
 * Casualties by Vehicle Type: A bar chart showing the distribution of casualties across different vehicle types.
 * CY Casualties vs PY Casualties Monthly Trend: A line chart comparing the monthly trend of casualties in the current year (CY) to the previous year (PY).
 * Casualties by Urban/Rural: A pie chart showing the percentage of casualties occurring in urban and rural areas.
 * Casualties by Location: A map visualizing the distribution of casualties across different locations.
 * Casualties by Road Type: A bar chart showing the distribution of casualties across different road types.
 * Casualties by Light Condition: A pie chart showing the percentage of casualties occurring under different light conditions.

## Conclusion
While the overall number of accidents and casualties has decreased, the dashboard raises concerns about the persistence of fatal accidents. Further analysis is needed to understand the factors contributing to these fatalities, such as road conditions, driver behavior, and vehicle safety features. Additionally, targeted interventions could be implemented to address the disproportionate number of accidents on single carriageway roads and during dark conditions. The dashboard serves as a valuable tool for policymakers and road safety organizations to identify areas for improvement and implement effective strategies to reduce road accidents and casualties.
